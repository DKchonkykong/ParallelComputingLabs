# CUDA Lab 3: Memory Management & Dot Product

[← Back to Main README](README.md) | [Next: CUDA Lab 4 →](CUDA-Lab4.md)


## SMART Objectives

Establish a Baseline: Implement a vector dot product on the CPU to understand the 
logic.
2. Master Unified Memory: Learn to use cudaMallocManaged to simplify data exchange.
3. Understand Shared Memory: Learn how to allocate and use on-chip Shared Memory to 
reduce global memory latency.
4. Implement Block Reduction: Learn exactly how to map global data to shared memory, 
synchronize threads, and calculate subtotals on the GPU.

## Completed Tasks

Exercise 1: CPU-Only Solution in C++ (Baseline)

Exercise 1.1 CPU‑Only Implementation

Exercise 1.2: CPU+GPU Solution in CUDA


Exercise 2: Vector Dot-Product using Unified Memory


Exercise 2.1: Dynamic Managed Memory


Exercise 2.2: Static Managed Memory 


Exercise 3: Vector Dot-Product using Shared Memory


## Reflection

Not here sadly not yet anyway...
