# CUDA LAB 2

[← Back to Main README](README.md) | [Next: Cuda lab 3→](CUDA-Lab3.md)


## SMART Objectives
1. Master Thread Indexing: Learn how to calculate the Global Index of a thread to map it 
to a specific data element in an array.
2. Understanding Grids and Blocks: Move beyond single-block kernels to use multiple 
blocks (gridDim) and multiple threads (blockDim).
3. Multi-Dimensional Configuration: Learn to organize threads in 2D and 3D using dim3.
4. Matrix Operations: Apply 2D indexing to perform Matrix Addition.
